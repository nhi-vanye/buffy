This is the README to accompany the Buffy theme engine for GTK+


Buffy is meant to be a facsimile for the SGI Motif UI (also known
as Buffed Motif).

Buffed Motif comprises a lot of Motif widget re-writing to change
the UI look and feel, and a number of color schemes. Buffy comprises
a theme engine and a few selected color schemes (not all the SGI
ones have been converted---because I'm lazy).

While I work for SGI, this is not a SGI product, and there is no SGI IP
here, the engine was written simply by inspecting the pixels that were
being drawn on screen (oglsnoop is your friend). In fact if you have
the impression that by looking at this code that Buffed Motif is simple
then I've succeded in fooling you... But to cover by butt, here's the
standard disclaimer...

As I said earlier, this is a facsimilie for the real SGI look and
feel, this is mainly a limitation of the current GTK+ theme engine
APIs and infact the whole GTK+ toolkit [1].
